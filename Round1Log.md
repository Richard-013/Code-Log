## Log

### Day 1 - Friday - 14/02

Started work on Crazy Eights card game Unity project. Made a rough plan of the requirements for the basic game functionality (ignored UI/Animation etc. for now).

Implemented the Card class to hold individual card data and a Deck class that generates the instances for the cards. Added an altered Fisher-Yates shuffle as a shuffle function for the deck.

Started work on game management class and player class. Reworked some of the initial code to better suit the use of a game manager entity.
